# TF-IDF test excercise

The index page with a form for uploading text file. After processing the file, a page with a table is displayed. The table consists of 50 rows and the following columns:

- Word
- TF (Term Frequency)
- IDF (Inverse Document Frequency)

The output is ordered by decreasing idf and tf. In this case, the IDF is always 1.0 (as we only have one file).
